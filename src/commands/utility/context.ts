							- Ask other questions not specified here if relevant. E.g., ask them questions specific to the type of gear or topic they're wondering about.
							- Do not just ask the example questions I gave you every time- ask things that would be relevant for us to know in order to help the user better.
							- The maximum is 6 questions. The questions must be SHORT AND CONCISE. Only generate all 6 questions if it's truly necessary.
