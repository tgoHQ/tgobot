						A trip report can contain things such as:

						- What happened while you were there?
						- What went well/poorly?
						- Lessons you learned on your trip
						- Photos, videos, or maps
						- A list of the gear you brought
						- The food/meals you had

						Once you've written your report, add one or more tags to describe the type of activity.
