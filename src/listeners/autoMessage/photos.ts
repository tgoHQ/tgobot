				- If this post is a writeup of your camping/hiking/backpacking/etc trip, please post it in ${await CHANNEL_TRIP_REPORTS()} instead.
				- If you have more unrelated photos to share later, create a separate post for them.
				
			**For everyone**:
				- This thread is for discussion of the photos shared above, not for general chatting.
				- React to this post with ðŸ«˜ to upvote it! Each week, the post with the most beans is crowned "Photo of the Week".
